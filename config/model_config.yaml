# Model Configuration
# 
# USE: Defines model hyperparameters, feature lists, and training settings
# WHAT WILL BE BUILT: Configuration for Phase 1 baseline models:
#   - Linear/Ridge regression for spread and total
#   - Logistic regression for win probability
#   - Feature lists and preprocessing options
# HOW IT WORKS: Loaded by model training scripts to configure model behavior
# FITS IN PROJECT: Centralizes model settings, making it easy to experiment
#   with different configurations without changing code

# Phase 1 Baseline Models
models:
  spread:
    type: "Ridge"  # Options: LinearRegression, Ridge
    alpha: 1.0  # Regularization strength for Ridge
    fit_intercept: true
    normalize: false  # Use StandardScaler instead
  
  total:
    type: "Ridge"
    alpha: 1.0
    fit_intercept: true
    normalize: false
  
  win_probability:
    type: "LogisticRegression"
    penalty: "l2"  # L2 regularization
    C: 1.0  # Inverse of regularization strength
    fit_intercept: true
    max_iter: 1000

# Feature Engineering Settings
features:
  # Minimal feature set for Phase 1
  include:
    - team_rating_diff  # Elo or SRS difference
    - home_field_advantage  # Binary indicator
    - point_diff_avg  # Rolling average point differential
    - league_indicator  # NFL vs NCAA (if using combined model)
  
  # Rating system to use
  rating_system: "elo"  # Options: "elo", "srs"
  
  # Rolling window for averages (in games)
  rolling_window: 8  # Last 8 games
  
  # Minimum games required for a team to have stats
  min_games_for_stats: 3

# Training Settings
training:
  # Historical data range (seasons)
  min_season: 2018
  max_season: 2023
  
  # Test/validation split
  test_size: 0.2
  validation_size: 0.1
  
  # Cross-validation folds
  cv_folds: 5
  
  # Walk-forward validation (for backtesting)
  walk_forward: true
  walk_forward_window: 3  # Train on last 3 seasons, test on next

# Model Storage
model_storage:
  base_dir: "models/"
  nfl_dir: "models/nfl/"
  ncaa_dir: "models/ncaa/"
  file_format: "joblib"  # Options: joblib, pickle

# Prediction Settings
prediction:
  # Confidence interval (for Phase 2, placeholder here)
  confidence_level: 0.95
  
  # Minimum confidence threshold for displaying predictions
  min_confidence: 0.0  # Phase 1: all predictions shown
